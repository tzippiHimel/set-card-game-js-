                <h1>How to win the set game?</h1>

                Set Puzzles are created with a deck of cards from the Set Gameâ„¢. The object of the puzzle is to find
                sets of
                3 cards in a rectangle of cards that have been dealt face up.<br>
                There are 81 cards in a deck. Each card contains a unique variation of the following four features:
                color,
                symbol, number and shading.<br><br>
                <span id="space">
                    <li>there are three colors:&nbsp;
                        pink, blue, purple</li><br>

                    <li>there are three symbols:&nbsp;
                        glasses emoji, heart emoji, star emoji</li><br>

                    <li>there is a number of symbols on the card:&nbsp;
                        one, two, three</li><br>

                    <li>there are three shadings: &nbsp;
                        solid, open, striped</li>
                </span>
                <br>
                Three cards form a set if each feature is either the same on each card, or is different on each card.
                For
                instance: all 3 cards are red, all 3 cards have a different symbol, all 3 cards have a different number
                of
                symbols, all 3 cards are striped.<br>
                There are two degrees of difficulty: basic and advanced. The basic mode deals 9 cards, that contain
                exactly
                4 sets; the advanced mode deals 12 cards that contain exactly 6 sets.<br>
                <br>
                For instance:<br>
