# Set Game 🎴

This is a web implementation of the classic **Set** card game, built using **JavaScript**, **HTML**, and **CSS**.

## 🕹️ About the Game

**Set** is a pattern-recognition card game. Each card has four features:

* **Shape**
* **Color**
* **Number**
* **Shading**

Each feature can vary in three ways. A valid **set** is a group of three cards in which each feature is either:

* **All the same**, or
* **All different**

For example, if all three cards have the same shape, different colors, different numbers, and the same shading — it's a valid set.
